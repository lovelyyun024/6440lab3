The following exercise requires performing a JOIN on two tables, which will align the tables along a single column. To make this
easier for those who are not familiar with SQL, the bulk of the SQL statement is given for you. You should only need to edit the variables
at the top of the function in alignment with the OMOP CDM schema.

An example of a full JOIN statement performed on the person and f_person tables:
>>> SELECT * FROM person INNER JOIN f_person ON person.person_id=f_person.person_id;

Note additionally the inclusion of the "result.keys()" usage. This allows you to access the column descriptions from the query itself,
not using the local models provided. For this particular case, as a JOIN can produce any number of columns in any order, pulling this
from the result will help align the data with the request more directly. It will be used in the exercise_3 function to dynamically
determine the index of the column requested. Please read the description given in the student_code.py file for more information before
writing any code here.
